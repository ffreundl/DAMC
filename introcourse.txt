data analysis flowchart (ends) (data has to be summarized) :
-Descriptive (w/o interpretation)
-Exploratory (with interpretaton, w/ quantifying if the results can be retrieved in a new sample)
-Inferential (with int,with quant. in a new sample, w/o if a change can changing the avg, w/o trying to predict for new sample)
-Predictive (with int,with quant. in a new sample, w/o if a change can changing the avg, with trying to predict for new sample)
-Causal
-Mechanistic

Machine learning : algorithms able to improve their prerformance on base of the previous experience

a learner can take advantage of examples to capthre characteristics of interiest of their unknown enderlying probability distribution

three projects : due date 5th 10th and 15th weeks

Breaking Data : Heisenberg example, find a feature to quantify : facial hair. put a threshold. The model gives a possibility to find heisenberg amidst Pinkman and White. The model may not be good enough.
another model : head ornament. add  another border (a function of head ornament and facial hair)
a model is as good as the data it has.

Unsupervised learning : model the data distribution without desired target value

Supervised learning : learning by examples (inputs and corresponding target values). Minimization of an explicit error function. It means that we have a example set of inputs andtheir target outputs in order to improve the learning system. Can do test
training data are not the same thing as testing data. (You have to do this)

flannel is grunge !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Semi-supervised learning : information about the performance is providied without explicitly providing target values (when you did that, it was good !)
