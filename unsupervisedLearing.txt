Discover separate sub-classes (clusters) of data that are similar to each other
Characterize the  structure of the data. Estimate its probability density function.
Cocktail party problem : everybody talk in the same time. At the end we^re stil able to listen to our friend. It means that we're able to separate the data in different sources (talking people). Blind source operation
Exemple in neurpprsthetics : signals coming from unknown neurons -> the goal is to indentify neurons. output is action potential.
Cluster: set of points whose interpoint distances are smaller relatively to others.
K-Means (For K clusters)
mu_k is the center of a cluster
r_nk = 1 if x_n belongs to the cluster k.
J=sumofN sum of K rnk*(x_nk-mu_k)^2.
optimization (derivation=0) --> mu_k=sumofN(r_nk*x_n)/sumofN(r_nk).
but we have to do the clustering (iterative methods) : set initial centers (randomly)
2 separate the data into clusters around the centers
3 recalculate the centers in function of the current clusters
4 redo 2 (with a precision criterium, or if no data move anymore)
